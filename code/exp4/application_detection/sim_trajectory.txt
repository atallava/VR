rangeImages not cleaned before being passed for line finding.
getLinesAnecdote does not throw longer lines. Only recall code is active.
lengthTolerance = 5e-3
Both have crappy performance.

Both still have crappy performance but exact performance.

Sim is actually doing worse than real here.

Recall does not increase. Time to shift to increasing precision.

I seem to have hit a PR-threshold here.
