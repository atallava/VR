* timber might be crooked, but probably better to use consistent piece than add a number of wooden pieces. think of how to eliminate errors due to this: look for systematic errors in world coordinates
* neato doesn't listen to all velocities
* neato will drift under such small velocities. what to do? manually rearranging is not nice. could argue that anyway rotating the robot does not imply rotation about the sensor axis -> what would such a motion be? actual drift is in the shape of a rectangle
* on the runs
run1.mat is at 10 blocks out. but robot didn't seem to complete one full rotation
run2.mat is the same environ as run1.mat, just rotated robot some more for complete 360 deg data.
run3.mat is at 8 blocks out
run4.mat is at 6 blocks out
run5.mat, 4
run6.mat, 2
run7,mat, 1
* laser spins at 5Hz, not 10Hz. So ideally should be pausing 0.2 seconds before collecting data. this means that for run1-run4.mat, pick every other measurement. this also implies working with 50 data points. let that be consistent then across all runs
* run6 and run7 are performed with a different wooden board, because the old one was suddenly warped. there goes repeatibility. divide experiments into two sets then: near and far range.

* raw_data.mat contains arrays ranges1, ranges2 ... ranges6. ranges1 is formed by combining range_data from run1 and run2, then taking every odd reading. ranges2-3 are formed by taking every odd reading of range_data from runs3-4, respectively. ranges4-6 are range_data from run5-7. 

* i don't understand why the drift values from each run vary. is it a bug in the code.
* should have done closed-loop control to turn the neato by 1 degree. now i am not sure of anything.
