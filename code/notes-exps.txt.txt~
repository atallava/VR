* timber might be crooked, but probably better to use consistent piece than add a number of wooden pieces. think of how to eliminate errors due to this: look for systematic errors in world coordinates
* neato doesn't listen to all velocities
* neato will drift under such small velocities. what to do? manually rearranging is not nice. could argue that anyway rotating the robot does not imply rotation about the sensor axis -> what would such a motion be? actual drift is in the shape of a rectangle
* on the runs
run1.mat is at 10 blocks out. but robot didn't seem to complete one full rotation
run2.mat is the same environ as run1.mat, just rotated robot some more for complete 360 deg data.
run3.mat is at 8 blocks out
run4.mat is at 6 blocks out
run5.mat, 4
run6.mat, 2
* laser spins at 5Hz, not 10Hz. So ideally should be pausing 0.2 seconds before collecting data. this means that for run1-run4.mat, pick every other measurement. this also implies working with 50 data points. let that be consistent then across all runs
