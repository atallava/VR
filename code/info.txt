contents of data_22Jan:
* moved robot in straight line. at 20 poses, took 500 readings of world.
code/exp3/processed_data.mat derived from above file. contains a struct array called datax-position in world, and range readings of ids 1-10, 351-360. assuming that these readings are from a static world.

contents of data_Feb7:
* made a mistake: no time logs of encoder returns.

data_Feb7
Range readings in artificial environment for building simulator. Robot: mega.

data_mar27
Range readings in artificial environment for building simulator. Robot: peta.

data_may5_peta
Collected data to test maximum range of laser and unexplained large-range readings. Robot: peta.

data_june6
To test simulator on line-finding. Robot: peta.

full_predictor_mar27_1
29 training poses

full_predictor_mar27_2
42 training poses

full_predictor_mar27_3
29 training poses. single model for all pixels (collated and compressed data), using nullFraction for pz.

full_predictor_mar27_4
same as above but performing no-pool predictions for pz.

full_predictor_mar27_5
used local matching to create the muPxRegBundle, other regressors as in _4. trained with canonical 29 poses.

full_predictor_mar27_6
used local matching + indiscriminate pooling to create the muPxRegBundle. trained with canonical 29 poses. 

application_scan_match:
application_test_data
data is a struct array with fields 'poses', 'ranges'. 20 ranges for each pose to obtain error on. Pattern set is for displacing reference pose. Constructed from data_mar27. 
The poses are not in the training poses for full_predictor_mar27_{1,3,4}

smoothness_tester
all 42 poses, \emph{but mu and sigma are the same for all pixels}. 

code/exp6/
full_predictor_means_only_mar27_1
trained on all poses. sigma and pz are zero in all predictions.

full_predictor_means_only_mar27_2
trained on 29 poses. sigma and pz are zero in all predictions.

simulated_means_mar27
robot placed in poses of mar27 and ranges generated from map.raycast()

local_geom_regressor_instance
localGeomRegressor instance, with muArray from full_predictor_means_only_mar27_1

density_data
triplets is a set of observed three consecutive (and non-nan) ranges from all training poses.

code/misc/kde
scores has scores1, hist similarity scores between real histograms and normWithDrops, scores2, hist similarity between kernel density estimate and normWithDrops
