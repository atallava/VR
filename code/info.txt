contents of data_22Jan:
* moved robot in straight line. at 20 poses, took 500 readings of world.
code/exp3/processed_data.mat derived from above file. contains a struct array called datax-position in world, and range readings of ids 1-10, 351-360. assuming that these readings are from a static world. 

code/exp4:
contents of data_Feb7:
* made a mistake: no time logs of encoder returns.

data_Feb7
Range readings in artificial environment for building simulator. Robot: mega.

data_mar27
Range readings in artificial environment for building simulator. Robot: peta.

data_may5_peta
Collected data to test maximum range of laser and unexplained large-range readings. Robot: peta.

data_june6
To test simulator on line-finding. Robot: peta.

data_sep6_micro_train
100 poses to train simulator on.

data_sep6_micro_train
50 poses to train simulator on.

data_sep13_micro
data from which to analyze localization-via-registration bounds.

data_sep14_micro
data to test pose sensitivity when registering in nsh3_corridor

full_predictor_mar27_1
canonical 29 training poses. individual models for each pixel.

full_predictor_mar27_2
same as above, but with all poses as (42) training poses.

full_predictor_mar27_3
29 training poses. single model for all pixels (collated and compressed data), using nullFraction for pz.

full_predictor_mar27_4
same as above but performing no-pool predictions for pz.

full_predictor_mar27_5
used local matching to create the muPxRegBundle, other regressors as in _4. trained with canonical 29 poses.

full_predictor_mar27_6
used local matching + indiscriminate pooling to create the muPxRegBundle. trained with canonical 29 poses. 

application_scan_match:
application_test_data
data is a struct array with fields 'poses', 'ranges'. 20 ranges for each pose to obtain error on. Pattern set is for displacing reference pose. Constructed from data_mar27. 
The poses are not in the training poses for full_predictor_mar27_{1,3,4}

smoothness_tester
all 42 poses, \emph{but mu and sigma are the same for all pixels}. 

code/exp6/
full_predictor_means_only_mar27_1
trained on all poses. sigma and pz are zero in all predictions.

full_predictor_means_only_mar27_2
trained on 29 poses. sigma and pz are zero in all predictions.

simulated_means_mar27
robot placed in poses of mar27 and ranges generated from map.raycast()

local_geom_regressor_instance
localGeomRegressor instance, with muArray from full_predictor_means_only_mar27_1

density_data
triplets is a set of observed three consecutive (and non-nan) ranges from all training poses.

code/misc/kde
scores has scores1, hist similarity scores between real histograms and normWithDrops, scores2, hist similarity between kernel density estimate and normWithDrops

code/playback
data_july3 
encoder and laser logs collected from continuously driving the robot around in a small map.

data_july3_map
the map for the above data

playback_data_july3
data_july3 contains data in classes that have since been modified. This file contains the data in the useful form: to be viewed in playback. Useful for sensor fusion offsets testing.

sample_sensor_data_1
Data to test playback.

code/wanderer
data_aug19_1
from peta. ~1000 pieces of data from the laser, to definitively settle the question of how many data points to collect to 

estimate mu, sigma, pz

data_aug19_2
from peta. data to demonstrate weird encoder jumps

data_aug19_3
from peta. more data to demonstrate weird encoder jumps
