How do you shutdown the simulator?
OOP in MATLAB
subclasses do not inherit superclass attributes
in lineObject.m:
why is there an empty private Access methods block?

Experimental Characterization of Commercial Flash Ladar Devices

Scanning from a moving platform introduces motion artifacts: also true for 360 count laser. Examine effects of range, reflectivity and angle of incidence on range measurements.
What is saturation of a sensor?
